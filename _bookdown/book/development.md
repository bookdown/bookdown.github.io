# Development

Bookdown needs your help! We are eager to bring in contributors who are interested in DocBook-like documentation, but without the heavy toolchain and XML of DocBook itself.

If you are a developer, you can clone or fork the [core library repository](https://github.com/bookdown/Bookdown.Bookdown) from Github. We plan to use the [Issues](https://github.com/bookdown/Bookdown.Bookdown/issues) as the main means of community communication. [Pull Requests](https://github.com/bookdown/Bookdown.Bookdown/pulls) especially are appreciated, particularly for items on [the Todo list](https://github.com/bookdown/Bookdown.Bookdown#todo).

If you are a designer, you can already tell that we are design-challenged. It would be awesome if we could provide a good-looking stylesheet out-of-the-box for the [Bookdown project skeleton](https://github.com/bookdown/Bookdown.Project).  In addition, we are interested in figuring out a way to provide Composer-deliverable themes for Bookdown, so that other design-challenged developers can make their work look good.
