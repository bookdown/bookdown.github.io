# What Is Bookdown?

Bookdown generates [DocBook](http://docbook.org)-like HTML output using [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org) (a variation of Markdown) and JSON files instead of XML.

Bookdown is especially well-suited for publishing project documentation to GitHub Pages.

Features include:

- Automatic table-of-contents generation as index pages at each hierarchy level

- Custom index-page titles via JSON configuration

- Automatic numbering of page headings

- Automatic previous/next/up navigation headers and footers

- Multi-page hierarchical output

- Loading of remote content files via HTTP

- Templated output for theming

- Overridable page processing, especially for rendering

- Downloading of linked images

- CommonMark extension support

- Depth level of table of contents

- Setting a copyright hint

- Support for 3rd party templates

Bookdown can be used as a static site generator, or as a way to publish static pages as a subdirectory in an existing site.
